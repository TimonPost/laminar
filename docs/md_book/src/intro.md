## Introduction

Welcome! This book will teach you everything you need to know about of the networking in laminar.
We will discuss important parts of network programming, why we made certain decisions and some explanations about networking concepts in general.

Laminar is free and open source software, distributed under a dual license of [MIT][ml]
and [Apache][al]. This means that the engine is given to you at no cost
and its source code is completely yours to tinker with. The code is available on
[GitHub][am]. Contributions and feature requests will always be welcomed!

[am]: https://github.com/amethyst/laminar/tree/master

## Motivation
Laminar is fully written in Rust and therefore it has no garbage collector, no data-races, and memory safety. 
That's why laminar is a good candidate to be a safe and better replacement for other reliable-UDP implementations.
This library is written for use in the Amethyst game engine, however, we fully believe that this library can become an excellent reliable UDP implementation in its own right.
