- Change `SocketEvent::Connect` to only fire when a connection has been established.
- Add `SocketEvent::Disconnect` to fire when a Timeout fires from an endpoint with an established connection.
- Change `SocketEvent::Timeout` to fire when a Timeout fires from an endpoint with an unestablished connection.
- Change heartbeats to only send after a connection has been established.
- Add a `max_unestablished_connections` config option to prevent connection memory overflow attack

## [0.1.0] - 2018-11-12
The Networking team is happy to announce the release of `0.1.0`` of the [laminar crate](https://github.com/amethyst/laminar). 
It provides UDP networking modified for the needs of game networking. 
Most of the techniques used were published and detailed by [Glenn Fiedler](https://gafferongames.com/). 
Weâ€™d like to extend a special thanks to him and his articles.

### Added 

- UDP-based protocol
- Automatic Fragmentation
- RTT estimation
- Connection tracking
- Unreliable and Reliable sending of packets
- Protocol version monitoring
- A link conditioner to simulate packet loss and latency
- Good error handling with **zero** panics
- Well tested by integration and unit tests
- Benchmarks
