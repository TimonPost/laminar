//! Laminar semi-reliable UDP protocol for multiplayer games. This library implements wraps around a UDP
//! and provides light weight stream based interface that provides certain guarantees like reliability.
//!
//! Laminar was designed to be used within the [Amethyst][amethyst] game engine.

//!
//! # Concepts
//!
//! This library is mostly based off of [Gaffer on Games][gog] and shares features with RakNet. The idea is to provide a low level
//! UDP protocol that supports the use cases of video games that require multilayer features. The library
//! itself provides a few low level types of packets that provides different types of guarantees. The most
//! basic are unreliable and reliable packets. This generally correlates to state update packets that do not
//! require to be synced, meaning the packet can get dropped without harm to the game. The other is used for
//! example score updates, where you want to make sure that the data is received on the other end even in case
//! of a packet drop. For more information, read the projects [README.md][readme]

//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use laminar::{Config, Packet, Socket};
//!
//! use std::{
//!     net::Ipv4Addr,
//!     thread
//! };
//!
//! fn main() {
//!   let addr = "127.0.0.1:12345".parse().unwrap();
//!
//!   let (mut socket, packet_sender, event_receiver) = Socket::bind(addr, Config::default()).unwrap();
//!   let _thread = thread::spawn(move || socket.start_polling());
//!
//!   let data = "example data".as_bytes();
//!   let packet: Packet = Packet::reliable_unordered(addr, data.to_vec());
//!
//!   packet_sender.send(packet).unwrap();
//!
//!   let data = event_receiver.recv().unwrap();
//!   println!("{:?}", data);
//! }
//! ```
