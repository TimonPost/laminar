//! Laminar is a semi-reliable UDP-based protocol for multiplayer games. This library implements wrappers around the UDP-protocol,
//! and provides a lightweight, message-based interface which provides certain guarantees like reliability and ordering.
//!
//! Laminar was designed to be used within the [Amethyst][amethyst] game engine but is usable without it.

//! # Concepts
//!
//! This library is loosely based off of [Gaffer on Games][gog] and has features similar to RakNet, Steam Socket, and netcode.io.
//! The idea is to provide a native Rust low-level UDP-protocol which supports the use of cases of video games that require multiplayer features.
//! The library itself provides a few low-level types of packets that provide different types of guarantees. The most
//! basic are unreliable and reliable packets. Ordering, sequencing can be done on multiple streams.
//! For more information, read the projects [README.md][readme], [book][book], [docs][docs] or [examples][examples].
